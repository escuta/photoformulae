Dilute the stock-solution 1+2 with water. For a higher contrast, dilute 1+1 with water. Development times are usually around 1.5 to 3 minutes depending on the paper type used.

This developer is described by Ansel Adams in "The Print" as being very similar to Kodak Dektol as sold in dry powder form.

For warmer tones, dilute 1+3 or 1+4 and add 8 ml of a 10% potassium bromide solution to each litre of working strength developer.
