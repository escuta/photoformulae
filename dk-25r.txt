DK-25R Formula

*** [SEE JOHN FINCH'S BETTER METHOD AT BOTTOM OF THE PAGE FOR 1000ml] ****


       700ml Water at 52°C
    Pinch of the Sodium Sulfite below 
    Metol – 10g
    Sodium Sulfite – 100g
    Sodium Metaborate – 20g ou 800ml of solution below *****
    Water to Make 1L


OR

	350ml Water at 52°C
	Metol – 5g
 	Sodium Sulfite – 50g
	Sodium Metaborate – 10g ou 400ml of solution below  *****
 	Water to Make 500ml


***** To make a Metaborate Solution

Sodium Metaborate Solution, 40ml = 1g

       310ml Water at 52°C
       Borax 7g
       Sodium Hydroxide 1.5g (use plate and paper)
       Water to make *400ml*


Iain's Adaptation


prepare Sodium Sulfite – 50g numa container e set asside

350ml Water at 52°C
Borax 7g
Sodium Hydroxide 1.5g (use plate and paper)

Add pinch of the Sodium Sulphite below
Metol – 5g
Sodium Sulfite – 50g
Water to Make 500ml

DK-25R - D-23 Replenisher

Chemical Amount
Water 52C 650ml
Pinch of the sodium sulphite below 
Metol 10g
Sodium sulphite 100g
Sodium metaborate* 20g
Water to make 1 Ltr

*If you can't get sodium metaborate you can replace it in this formula with 14g Borax + 3g Sodium Hydroxide.
- After dissolving the rest of the chemicals calculate how much water will be needed to top up the amount to 1 Ltr.
- Then use this calculated amount at 50C to dissolve the borax followed by the hydroxide.
- Allow to sit for ten minutes with occasional stirring.
- Then add to the other part and mix.
