Agfa 304


Water at 52°C						750ml (500ml)
Sodium thiosulphate (tiossulfato de sódio)		200g
Ammonium chloride (Cloreto de amônio)			50g (234ml of 4M solution)*
Potassium metabisulphite (Metabissulfito De Potássio)	20g
Water to make 1 litre		<1000ml

Use undiluted. Fix paper for 3-5 minutes. Fix film for three times clearing time.

* 4M 1000ml solução de cloreto de amônio está disponível
Molecular weight of Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is 53.491 g/mol
So, a 1M solution has 53.5g of NH4Cl in 1000ml of water.
1000ml of a 4M solution has 214g of HH4Cl
Therefore: We need 234ml of 4M NH4Cl solution to provide 50g
